    <p>Dear {{ grant.contact_first_name }} {{ grant.contact_last_name }},</p>

    {% if grant.must_reimburse_uc and not grant.reimbursed_uc %}

        <p>We have reviewed your receipts, and it looks like you didn't spend the full amount that you were granted on items
            for which you were granted funds for <i>{{ grant.project }}</i>. As such, we are asking that you reimburse the UC
            <b>{{ grant.reimburse_uc_amount | usd }}</b>.</p>
        <p>If you choose not reimburse the UC this amount, then you will go into bad standing with the UC which will make you
            ineligible for future grants. If you feel that our evaluation of your spending is not correct, you are welcome to
            appear before the UC Financial Hearing Committee.</p>

        {% if grant.treasurer_notes %}
            <p>The following note was attached to your grant by the final reviewer of your application: <i>{{ grant.treasurer_notes }}</i></p>
        {% endif %}

        <p>Please repspond to this email to coordinate your reimbursement with the UC Treasurer or to setup a time for a hearing.
            In order to avoid going into bad standing with the UC, your reimbursement will be due two weeks from today.</p>

    {% else %}

        <p>Congratulations! Your receipts have been approved by the undergraduate council, which means that you have completed the full grant process
            for <i>{{ grant.project }}</i>.</p>

        {% endif %}

        <p>Thank you for applying for a UC Grant, and we hope to see you again soon!</p>
