    <p>Dear {{ grant.contact_first_name }} {{ grant.contact_last_name }},</p>
    <p>An interview has been scheduled for your grant application <i>{{ grant.project }}</i>. The interview is scheduled for:</p>
    <div style="text-align:center;margin:15px;font-size:1.5em;"><b>{{ grant.interview_schedule_date | datetime }}</b></div>
    <p>The interview will occur in the basement of Memorial Hall in the classrooms just beyond "FlyBy." Please send a representative
        from your organization to attend the interview (it does not have to be you.)
        In order for your grant application to receive any funding, someone from {{ grant.organization }} must attend the interview.
        {%- if grant.is_collaboration %}
            Since you indicated that your project is a collaboration between multiple student organizations on your application,
            you are eligible for certain benefits which could result in additional funding for your grant. However, to secure these
            benefits you must have one representative from a majority of the organizations you are collaborating with
            (<i>{{ grant.collaborators }}</i>) attend the interview in addition
            to the representative from {{ grant.organization }}.
        {% endif -%}
        If you are more than 10 minutes late to your assigned interview, you may not be seen until the next interview week.
    </p>
    <p>As always, you can <a href="{{ url_for('grant', grant_id=grant.grant_id, key=grant.key, _external=True)}}">track the status of your grant on our portal</a>.</p>
    <p>Best,
    <br>{{ treasurer_name }}
    <br><i>Treasurer, Undergraduate Council</i></p>
